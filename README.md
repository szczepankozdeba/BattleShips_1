This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for an embedded Battleship game project implemented on an STM32 embedded system. 
The project utilizes external peripherals such as LED matrices, keyboards, and LCD displays to create a functional Battleship game.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a digital version of the classic Battleship board game that runs on an STM32 microcontroller. 
The game is designed to showcase the capabilities of embedded systems and their interaction with various external peripherals.

Features:
LED Matrices: The game board is displayed on LED matrices, providing a visual representation of the Battleship grid.
Keyboard Input: Players can input their moves using an external keyboard, making the game interactive and engaging.
LCD Displays: LCD displays show game status, player turns, and other relevant information.
Real-Time Gameplay: The game offers real-time gameplay, allowing players to take turns and strategize.

Getting Started
To run the game on your STM32 embedded system, follow these steps:
Connect the STM with peripherals according to the documentation.
Clone this repository to your development environment.
Set up your STM32 development environment and ensure that you have the necessary libraries and toolchains installed.
Compile the source code using your preferred development environment.
Flash the compiled code onto your STM32 microcontroller.
Connect the required peripherals (LED matrices, keyboard, LCD displays) to the appropriate GPIO pins on your STM32 board.
Power on the STM32 board and start playing the Battleship game!
